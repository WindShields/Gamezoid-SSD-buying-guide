Disclaimer: Drives can be removed or moved based on underlying issues or miscellanious performance characteristics even if
fitting category qualifications. SSD performance is extremely complicated and it is difficult to categorize using single number statistics, however this is preferrable
to no transparency at all in categorization. We do retain the ability to move around this methedology, SSD testing is extremely complicated, and reviewer drive conditioning, 
firmware changes, software, etc can massively impact the performance of an SSD on the bench. 
Some drive reviews may show that they do not meet the requirements of their respective category,this is typically due to the drives performance increasing or decreasing with firmware 
updates and fixes. 

Performance unless otherwise noted is based off of the 1tb variant of the drive.
This methodology is designed to work with the metrics of Sean Websters reviews from tomshardware.com, TBW is typically disregarded since it's an arbitrary measurement and not
a representive of real world endurance.
