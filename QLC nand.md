# Gamezoid-SSD-buying-guide: QLC NAND in consumer SSDs
This write-up is meant to suppliment the DRAMless SSDs write-up and explain QLC nand flash, and how it should affect your process shopping for an SSD.
When you look at an SSD on a marketplace like Amazon, Wish, Best Buy, Walmart, etc, you may see it advertised with "3D TLC" or "3D QLC". If you're unaware what this means, it's describing the amount of data that can be held within a single memory cell. There's tons of documentation on the technical nuances on this, so I'll try and keep this simple.
