# Gamezoid-SSD-buying-guide: QLC NAND in consumer SSDs
This write-up is meant to suppliment the DRAMless SSDs write-up and explain QLC nand flash, and how it should affect your process shopping for an SSD.
When you look at an SSD on a marketplace like Amazon, Wish, Best Buy, Walmart, etc, you may see it advertised with "3D TLC" or "3D QLC". If you're unaware what this means, it's describing the amount of data that can be held within a single memory cell. There's tons of documentation on the technical nuances on this, so I'll *try* and avoid going too much into detail.

Personally I hate the term SLC, MLC, TLC, QLC, since it can be used to mislead consumers (Samsung calling everything MLC). But each term describes how many bits can be stored in a single flash cell, a bit being a 1 or a 0, the funny numbers that make up all computational data. SLC can be described as 1LC, it can store one bit per cell, which means a single flash memory cell can either be a 1 or 0. MLC goes to 2 bits per cell, TLC (3 bits per cell), and QLC (4 bits per cell) This means that if you had two flash dies with the same amount of memory cells, a QLC die would be able to hold 4x as much data as an SLC die. As a result QLC is cheaper for manufactures to deploy, you need less raw material to acheive the same capacity.

How does this affect performance? The main technical difference between each type of flash is how precisely the cell is programmed. A QLC cell has 16 possible programmed states, meaning it takes longer to program (Charge) the cell to the desired level. As a result the largest performance metric that QLC nand flash hits is with writing. In an SSD review this is would be most apparent in a sustained sequential write. In the real world this translates to the copy of a large file transfer or copy, I wouldn't coorelate it with download speed since you're typically going to be limited by your internet bandwith before your SSD is a limitation. This poor performance is also the most apparant outside of the drives SLC cache, which means that the file transfers would have to be rather large in order to exhaust the cache and force the drive to write directly to QLC.
